This README summarizes the format of the register files, which contain contact
info for FROSTI users. email.txt and phone.txt store email addresses and phone
numbers respectively, and the '_test' files contain contact info for the
developers only. In addition, each entry is appended with a 'scope' variable
that indicates whether that user wishes to recieve alerts pertaining to the
freezers, vivarium, or all.
